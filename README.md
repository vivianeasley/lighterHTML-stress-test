# lighterHTML Stress Test

## [DEMO](https://vivianeasley.github.io/lighterHTML-stress-test/)

Just a test to see if re-rendering 1000+ views at the same time causes major issues in rendering. Uses Perlin noise to build the map. Each map tile is a DOM node with logic.

## To Run
npm install
npm run dev
